# ng-quickStart

This is a template for a simple Angular app with a single module. If you have Node and NPM installed, simply clone the repo, npm install dependencies, and then npm start. The start command will begin serving the client off of Port 3000 as well as using node-sass to compile the CSS into the style-min.css.

For quick testing try making a tiny dev server (it's easy I promise) by following the instructions at https://github.com/masondesu/tiny-server. Once you have that (or any other backend service you wish to use)
plug it into the "api" variable in the common/service.js file.

Enjoy!
