# ng-quickStart

This is a template for a simple Angular app with a single module.

### Set Up
For quick testing try making a tiny dev server (it's easy I promise) by following the instructions at https://github.com/masondesu/tiny-server. Once you have that (or any other backend service you wish to use)
plug it into the "api" variable in the common/service.js file.

### Run it
If you have Node and NPM installed, simply 'git clone https://github.com/rogersgt/ng-quickStart',
'cd /location/of/ng-quickStart', 'npm install', and then 'npm start'.

##### What happens
The start command will begin serving the client off of Port 3000 as well as using node-sass to compile the CSS into the style-min.css.

### Enjoy!
